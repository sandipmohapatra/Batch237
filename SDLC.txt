The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used for developing software applications. 
It involves several phases, each with specific tasks and objectives.
The goal of the SDLC is to produce high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates, and works efficiently and effectively in the current and planned IT infrastructure.


Planning:

Define project goals, scope, and constraints.
Conduct feasibility studies.
Develop a project plan, including timelines and resources.

Requirements Analysis:

Gather and analyze user and stakeholder requirements.
Document functional and non-functional requirements.
Create use cases and user stories.

Design:

Architect the overall system and software structure.
Create detailed designs for components, modules, and interfaces.
Develop data models and design databases.

Implementation (Coding):

Write the actual code based on the design specifications.
Perform unit testing to ensure individual components work correctly.

Testing:

Conduct various levels of testing (e.g., integration, system, acceptance).
Identify and fix defects and bugs.
Ensure the software meets the specified requirements.

Deployment:

Release the software to the production environment.
Ensure proper installation and configuration.
Train users and provide documentation.

Maintenance:

Monitor the software for any issues.
Perform regular updates and bug fixes.
Enhance the software with new features as required.

Evaluation (optional):

Review the project's success and the software's performance.
Gather feedback from users and stakeholders.
Document lessons learned and best practices for future projects.
